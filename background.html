          You're probably wondering why I made this site. And what's an Epicodus? Well, I'll tell you a little bit that, and how I got here, in just a moment. First, let me share this quote with you.

          I love solving problems. That's why I came to Epicodus. When I was a marketer, I used to solve problems like, how to turn page views into customers, and how to throw events for 100 or more people with limited resources. I had to learn a lot of it on my own, which developed my afinity for <em>making lists</em> and <em>extracting meaning from data</em>. My cowrokers were techies, and they also taught me how to <strong>document</strong> and <strong>atomate tasks</strong> in order to save time.

          These skills have helped me solve lots of problems, but I still want to learn more.<span class="bg-success">I think developers have a unique skillset that can empower people to solve problems, automate their lives, and get more organized.</span> I don't know about you, but I like the sound of that. Hopefully, learning how to program at Epicodus will help me do that for you.
